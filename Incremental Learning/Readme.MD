Question:
A. Develop an incremental learning based multivariate neural network model.
B. Develop an incremental learning based multivariate SVM.
Hint:
1. Divide data into three parts: ‘train1’ (40%), ‘train2’ (40%) and ‘test’ (20%)
2. Train different models on ‘train1’ and ‘train 2’ respectively and validate their
performance on respective train sets and test data.
3. Re-train model (trained on ‘train 1’) on train 2 (or any other). Should be done
using the same weights as ‘train 1’ model and not random weights.
4. Check the performance of model trained in Step 3 on train sets and test data.

The study can be conducted on any real / hypothetically generated data. You can
increase the number of train sets and play with the hyper-parameters for better
understanding.
Draw the comparative analysis.
